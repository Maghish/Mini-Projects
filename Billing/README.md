# The Pythonic Billing System
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description: 
This is a simple billing system which is designed by Python language. You can add items, search items in `Admin` mode and in `Customers` mode, you can search for available products and if you gave the exact name of the product, it will ask you to whether add it to the cart of yours. At last you can type the keyword "**`done`**" to end the search and return you the total price of the products in the cart.
### Tutorial:
 ```md
Modes:
1. Admin
2. Customer
3. Exit 
Select a option above: 
```
so this is the first thing that the program will prompt. there are total two modes in this system, `Admin` and `Customer`. `Admin` allows you the administrator permissions like adding items in the respected csv file and search it's price. `Customer` is the actual mode for _billing_ stuff. You can search for items and add them to your cart and get the total amount of money you need to pay to buy the items in your cart. **If you are wondering, is this the project? that's it? well technically yes. This is a mini project afterall.**
